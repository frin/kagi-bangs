# Kagi Bangs

This is an open-source, community maintained repository of [bangs](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html) used by [Kagi Search](https://kagi.com).

You can submit changes to improve accuracy of existing bangs as well as create new bangs for use in Kagi Search.

Accepted changes are deployed to our website weekly.


## Contribution Guidelines

Kagi Staff and maintainers of this repo have final say, but a good bang submission should follow some basic guidelines.

- The website must be reasonably well-known and widely used.
  For example, popular commercial services and forums are OK.
  Low-traffic independent sites, such as startups, local businesses, or personal blogs, are not OK.

- The trigger must be specific to the website, not a generic term or word.
  For example, "amazon.com" can have "!amazon" but not "!groceries".

- Each trigger must be unique.
  You can test your trigger on Kagi to see if a bang already exists with that trigger.

- You can use the [Categories](#categories) list below to find the Category and Subcategory that fits best.
  If you cannot find one, it can be omitted, or we can consider adding a new one.

- If the bang you wish to add does not fit the above criteria, you can still create a custom bang on your own Kagi account for your own use!
  See our [documentation](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html#custom-bangs) for details.

- Any modifications to bangs should be made to `/data/bangs.json`. `/data/kagi_bangs.json` provides bangs internal to Kagi itself (i.e., image search, search in a specific region)

### Region Bangs

Currently, not all 2-char ISO country codes for regions Kagi supports are mapped to region bangs.
Adding new region bangs will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

## Bang Format

```jsonc
{
  "s": "Metacritic",
  "d": "www.metacritic.com",
  "t": "mc",
  "u": "https://www.metacritic.com/search/{{{s}}}/",
  "c": "Online Services",
  "sc": "Search"
}
```

Key   | Description  | Required | Notes
------|--------------|----------|------
`s`   | Website name | yes      |
`d`   | Domain       | yes      |
`t`   | Trigger      | yes      | May contain letters, numbers, dashes (`-`), and underscores (`_`). No spaces or other special characters.
`u`   | URL template | yes      | Use `{{{s}}}` for query placeholder.
`c`   | Category     | no       |
`sc`  | Subcategory  | no       |
`fmt` | Format flags | no       | Array of strings; See below.

### Format Flags

The `fmt` field exists to tweak the behavior of how the bang is executed.
For the majority of bangs, you do not need to specify this - we use defaults that work for 99.9% of bangs.
But, it can be useful depending on the behavior of the website.

The field is an array of strings that act as a list of flags:

Flag                       | Description
---------------------------|----------------------
`open_base_path`           | When the bang is invoked with no query, opens the base path of the URL (`/`) instead of any path given in the template (e.g., `/search`)
`url_encode_placeholder`   | URL encode the search terms. Some sites do not work with this, so it can be disabled by omitting this.
`url_encode_space_to_plus` | URL encodes spaces as `+`, instead of `%20`. Some sites only work correctly with one or the other.

By default, all of these are enabled.
If you specify `fmt`, you must exhaustively specify each options you would like enabled.

## Did you know?

As a Kagi user, you can make your own custom bangs right now in the [Custom Bangs settings page](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/bangs.html#custom-bangs) or the [Search Shortcuts menu](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/search-shortcuts.html).

These will be instantly available to you and will override any global bangs.

This repository is for adding new or fixing existing *global* bangs to Kagi.


## Credits

Kagi bangs are made possible by [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) which invented the concept in 2008.
